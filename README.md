### 👋 Hello!

My name is Vincent. I'm a software engineer / Unity game developer.🌱 Besides loving my job, I’m currently learning Android development and documenting all my learnings in my personal blog - [Android Kotlin Weekly](https://vtsen.hashnode.dev/).

💞️ I document all my completed and on-going Android projects [here](https://vtsen.hashnode.dev/projects).

📫 I'm also available at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vinchamp77), [Medium](https://vtsen.medium.com/), and [Dev.to](https://dev.to/vtsen). Let's connect and be friends! We should all learn and grow together!
